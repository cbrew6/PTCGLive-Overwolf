This app will be used to track stats in PTCGLive

The goal is to 
1. Create a PTCGLive leaderboard
2. backup Game log files and upload for tracking (Automatic trainingcourt.com)
3. Show stats to user in a friendly manner and with nice graphics






1. Set Up Your Overwolf App
Install the Overwolf SDK and set up a new Overwolf project.
Configure manifest.json to specify overlays and permissions for screen reading.
2. Read Text on Screen
Use Overwolfâ€™s Game Events API if the game supports it.
For games without built-in event support, use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) like Tesseract.js to capture and process on-screen text.
3. Upload Data to Storage
Decide where to store the extracted text:
Cloud storage (AWS S3, Firebase, Google Drive)
A database (MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL)
Your own API (Express.js, Flask, or FastAPI)
Use fetch() or a library like axios to send data from your Overwolf app.
4. UI for User Interaction
Build a UI using HTML/CSS/JS or a framework like React.
Allow users to configure what text to capture and where to upload.
